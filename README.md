# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Background:
### Initial Concerns: 
Through our given credit loans data, our point of contact on this project insists we leverage the "imbalanced-learn" and "scikit-learn" libraries to build and evaluate models via resampling techniques. 
At its core, the loan data measures credit risk for users. We are using machine learning to solve this challenge/risk, but thus far (pre-challenge) have seen weak learner models. 
### Next Steps: 
Our "LendingClub" dataset will go through an oversampling process using the "RandomOverSampler" and "SMOTE" algorithims. Then we also use the "ClusterCentroids" algorithim for undersampling. 
Finally, we will use "SMOTEENN" as a combination approach. 
Ultimately, our goal here is to compare the two new ML models that ideally reduce bias. Our classifiers will predict the credit risk/user and we will evaluate the models with our final print outs.
